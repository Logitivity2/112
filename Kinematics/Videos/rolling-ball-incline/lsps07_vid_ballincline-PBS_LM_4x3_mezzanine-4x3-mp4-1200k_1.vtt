NARRATOR: A ball rolling down a
long incline will be used

00:04.230 --> 00:07.900
to show how position, velocity,
and acceleration of the ball

00:07.900 --> 00:11.470
change as it moves down the
incline.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.700
Five lights arranged along the
length of the track

00:13.700 --> 00:17.770
flash simultaneously once per
second.

00:17.770 --> 00:19.400
As the ball rolls down,

00:19.400 --> 00:22.470
it is directly above each of the
lights just as they flash.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.870
This gives us a record of the
positions of the ball

00:24.870 --> 00:27.800
at one-second intervals.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.600
This is how far the ball
traveled in the first second.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.470
This is how far the ball
traveled

00:33.470 --> 00:35.770
in the first two seconds.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.830
Three seconds.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.670
Four seconds.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.770
We will move this distance up to
a graph

00:41.770 --> 00:45.000
to keep track of position versus
time.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.800
Does position change linearly
over time?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.070
Next, we will graph the average
velocity of the ball

00:52.070 --> 00:54.170
during five different intervals

00:54.170 --> 00:58.400
to see how velocity varies as
the ball rolls down the incline.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.570
The ball moved this far during
the first second.

01:01.570 --> 01:04.600
It moved this far during the
next second.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.730
This far during the third
second.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.970
The fourth second.

01:09.970 --> 01:14.270
This gives us a graph of the
velocity of the ball over time.

01:14.270 --> 01:18.970
Does velocity increase linearly?

01:18.970 --> 01:22.000
Now we will graph the changes in
velocity versus time

01:22.000 --> 01:25.730
by graphing the differences in
successive velocities.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.730
What does this tell us about the
acceleration of the ball?
